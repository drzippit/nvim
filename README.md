# Nvim Configuration

This is the repo that contains my NeoVim configuration.

## Starting ----------

This config was based of the awesome work of TJ using [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). It has since evoled in a mix of [Snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) and [Mini.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim)
And taking ideas from [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/).
